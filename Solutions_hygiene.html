            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>Waste Treatment and Disposal Methods</strong> <br>
            <p class="paraContent">
               When people think about solid waste management, they likely associate it with garbage being dumped in landfills or incinerated. While such activities comprise an important part of the process, a variety of elements is involved in the creation of an optimal integrated solid waste management (ISWM) system. For example, treatment techniques act to reduce the volume and toxicity of solid waste. These steps can transform it into a more convenient form for disposal. Waste treatment and disposal methods are selected and used based on the form, composition, and quantity of waste materials.
            </p>
            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>Thermal Treatment</strong> <br>
            </p>
            <p class="paraContent">
                Thermal waste treatment refers to the processes that use heat to treat waste materials. Following are some of the most commonly used thermal waste treatment techniques: 
                <ul type="square">
                    <li><emphasis>Incineration </emphasis>is one of the most common waste treatments. This approach involves the combustion of waste material in the presence of oxygen. This thermal treatment method is commonly used as a means of recovering energy for electricity or heating. This approach has several advantages. It quickly reduces waste volume, lessens transportation costs and decreases harmful greenhouse gas emissions. </li>
                   <li> <empahsis>Gasification and Pyrolysis</empahsis> are two similar methods, both of which decompose organic waste materials by exposing waste to low amounts of oxygen and very high temperature. Pyrolysis uses absolutely no oxygen while gasification allows a very low amount of oxygen in the process. Gasification is more advantageous as it allows the burning process to recover energy without causing air pollution.</li>
                    <li><emphasis>Open Burning</emphasis> is a legacy thermal waste treatment that is environmentally harmful. The incinerators used in such process have no pollution control devices. They release substances such as hexachlorobenzene, dioxins, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and ash. Unfortunately, this method is still practiced by many local authorities internationally, as it offers an inexpensive solution to solid waste. </li>
                
                </ul>
            </p>    
            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>  Dumps and Landfills</strong> <br>
           
            </p>    
            <p class="paraContent"><strong>Sanitary Landfills</strong> <br>
                Sanitary landfills provide the most commonly used waste disposal solution. These landfills are desired to eliminate or reduce the risk of environmental or public health hazards due to waste disposal. These sites are situated where land features work as natural buffers between the environment and the landfill. For instance, the landfill area can be comprised of clay soil which is quite resistant to hazardous wastes or is characterized by an absence of surface water bodies or a low water table, preventing the risk of water pollution. The use of sanitary landfills presents the least health and environmental risk, but the cost of establishing such landfills is comparatively higher than other waste disposal methods.
            </p>   
            <p class="paraContent"><strong>Controlled Dumps</strong> <br>
                Controlled dumps are more or less the same as sanitary landfills. These dumps comply with many of the requirements for being a sanitary landfill but may lack one or two. Such dumps may have a well-planned capacity but no cell-planning. There may be no or partial gas management, basic record keeping, or regular cover. 
            </p>    
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Bioreactor Landfills</strong> <br>
                Bioreactor landfills are the result of recent technological research. These landfills use superior microbiological processes to speed up waste decomposition. The controlling feature is the continuous addition of liquid to sustain optimal moisture for microbial digestion. The liquid is added by re-circulating the landfill leachate. When the amount of leachate is not adequate, liquid waste such as sewage sludge is used.
            </p>    
            <p class="paraContentSubheading"> <strong>Biological Waste Treatment</strong> <br>
            </p>
            <p class="paraContent">
                Composting is another most frequently used waste disposal or treatment method which is the controlled aerobic decomposition of organic waste materials by the action of small invertebrates and microorganisms. The most common composting techniques include static pile composting, vermin-composting, windrow composting and in-vessel composting.
                <br><br>
                Anaerobic Digestion also uses biological processes to decompose organic materials. Anaerobic Digestion, however, uses an oxygen and bacteria-free environment to decompose the waste material where composting must have air to enable the growth of microbes.

            <p class="paraContent">Maintaining good hygiene is about more than looking good-- proper hygiene is one of the keys to a healthy lifestyle. By taking regular care of your body you can prevent disease, smell better, and feel cleaner without hours of effort or expensive products. Read on to learn about simple habits and hygiene acts that will keep you clean every day.
            </p>
            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>Maintaining dental hygiene </strong> <br>
               
            </p>    
            <p class="paraContent"><strong>Brush your teeth twice a day</strong> <br>
              
               Brush your teeth twice a day. Even if you're in a hurry, brushing your teeth will remove bits of food, bacteria, and stains that can cause problems if left to fester. Try brushing once in the morning and once before you go to bed, and spend at least two minutes each time you brush. It will keep you fresh the whole day.
               If you are constantly on the go, have a travel toothbrush in your purse or briefcase so you can pop into the bathroom at work.
               Spend equal time brushing the front, back, and tops of your teeth, especially the molars.
            </p> 
            <p class="paraContent"><strong>Floss at least once a day</strong> <br>
                Floss at least once a day. Your dentist is not lying when they say this is one of the most overlooked hygiene regimens in the United States. Regular flossing cleans the parts of your teeth a brush can't reach and stimulates healthy gum growth.
                Using a short piece of floss, get in between your teeth and along the gum line, using your fingers to add pressure.
                Talk to your orthodontist about ways to floss if you have braces, such as dental threads.
                Be sure to clean in between your back teeth too, using the floss around all sides of the molars.
                Mouthwash does not physically remove plaque and food and is not a substitute for flossing..
             </p>  

            <p class="paraContent"><strong>Regular visits to the dentist</strong> <br>
                Schedule regular visits to the dentist. While going to the dentist every six months is not strictly necessary for healthy adults, children and those with dental issues should talk to their dentists about frequent checkups. Monitor your teeth, note any changes or worrisome pains, and get your teeth professionally cleaned at a minimum of once a year. 
                Smokers, diabetics, and people with a history of cavities should see the dentist twice a year or more.
            
            </p> 
            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>Taking better showers</strong> <br>  
            <p class="paraContent"><strong>  Bathe or shower at least every two days</strong> <br>
                Bathing removes the oils, dirt, dead skin bacteria that you accumulate every day and is essential to having good hygiene. Showering frequently is the most important hygienic habit you can develop for your hair and skin.
                If you don't have access to a shower, a cloth and some water will help remove dirt and irritants from your skin.
                Showering too frequently can be bad for your skin as well -- once a day is enough.
            </p>    
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong> Take short, warm showers instead of long hot showers</strong> <br>
                Long showers don't only waste water and electricity, they can clog your pores and dry out your skin. The heat is also tough on your hair. A short shower is all you need and will promote healthy skin.
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Scrub your body well</strong> <br>
                Using soap and a loofah, sponge, or washcloth, wash your entire body well to scrub off dirt and skin. This allows new skin to grow and prevents infections or excess bacteria.
                Be sure to wash the areas you don't immediately think of -- feet, butt, genitals, and back.
                Use deodorant or perfume after showers in the morning.
                Try blasting 10-20 seconds of cold water right before you get out of the shower to close your pores and prevent sweating when you get out. 
            </p>
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Do not shampoo every day unless you have very oily hair</strong> <br>
                Shampoo removes dirt and grime, but it also strips your hair of natural oils needed for clean, healthy hair. Many dermatologists believe it is actually healthier to shampoo every few days than daily. [3]
                When you wash your head, be sure to scrub you scalp lightly with your fingers to remove dead skin cells.
                Always use conditioner after shampooing to return healthy oils back to your hair.

            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>Keeping your Home Hygienic</strong> <br> 
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Wash your hands frequently</strong> <br>
                The majority of food borne diseases are caused by human contamination, and the number one culprits are dirty hands. Protect yourself and people around you by washing your hands for 20 seconds using soap and warm water after using the bathroom, going outside, or handling food.
                If possible, turn the faucet off with your elbow to prevent recontamination.
            </p>
       
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Wash and disinfect your home surfaces regularly</strong> <br>
                The kitchen and the bathroom build up bacteria quickly, so stay ahead of the game by regularly wiping down your counter-tops, sinks, and toilets whenever they get dirty. Don't leave crumbs or food around your kitchen overnight, as this attracts ants and germs.
                Use a disinfected spray in you bathroom and kitchen once every few weeks.
                Dry surfaces after cleaning them so that they don't grow mold.
                Don't forget to steam or disinfect your curtains and furniture at least once a year too.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Keep food preparation areas clean and organized</strong> <br>
                Always use separate knives, cutting boards, and pans for raw meat, and wash dishes as soon as you can to prevent mold and germs.
                Designate certain utensils as "meat only" so that you don't get confused cooking.
            </p>
            <p class="paraContentSubheading"><strong>Living Hygienically</strong> <br> 
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Always wear clean clothes and underwear. </strong> <br>
                Dirty clothes breed bacteria and will be smelly and uncomfortable. Wash your clothes after you wear them and never put on sweaty or wet clothes.
                Tight clothes are more likely to get dirty and trap sweat.
                Remove tight or sweaty clothes soon after a workout to prevent build up. [8]
                UV from the sun is a powerful disinfectant that kills many bugs and bacteria
            </p>
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Drink enough water </strong> <br>
                Drink at least 8 glasses of water per day as it promotes a healthy immune system and is crucial to good hygiene. Drinking water helps keep your skin and mouth healthy, too. 
                Bring your own waterbottle to work, but be sure to disinfect it regularly
            </p>
            <p class="paraContent"> <strong>Keep your hands and nails clean </strong> <br>
                Clear the dirt in your nails and keep them short and tidy. Hangnails and cuts around your cuticles are major areas for infection and dirt buildup

             To properly wear your mask:

                Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin.
                Clean your hands before you put your mask on, before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
                When you take off your mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask or dispose of it in a trash bin if it’s a medical mask.
                Don’t use masks with valves.

                By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19. 

                To ensure good hygiene you should:
                
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. This eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses.
                Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands.
                Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.
